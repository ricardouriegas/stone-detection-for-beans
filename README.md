# Stone Detection for Beans Using Only Image Analysis  

This is a school activity aimed at learning PyQt6 and OpenCV for image processing.  

## How Does It Work?  

The program is simple and **only** works with two types of beans: `pintos` and `negros`. It analyzes the average color of the image, if the color is black, the program processes it using the `detectar_piedras_negros` function; otherwise, it uses the `detectar_piedras_pintos` function.  

For more details on how the program works, you can compile the documentation written in **LaTeX** [here](https://github.com/ricardouriegas/stone-detection-for-beans-document).
